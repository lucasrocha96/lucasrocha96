 and hosted them on HLDS to play with my friends. 

- at the age of fourteen, I was accepted at the technical school in computer science Etemb (Escola tÃ©cnica Magalhaes Barata) But i not finished cos'I didn't feel I was  not learning something usefull (like a Pascal or Cobol) "no one use this no more Why i am learning This?" 

- I learn some English, And i can use as well, but im not a good speaker language. Native Language> Portuguese.

- ðŸ”­ Learning Linux Terminal, Git, Github, Excel, Java And Html. 
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with About to be a DEV
