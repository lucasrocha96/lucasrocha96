- as a child I edited mods for Counter-Strike 1.6 ![counter_strike_16x_16](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93394405/144141779-e4905115-2b31-4cbe-be43-1e1b95968c07.png) and hosted them on HLDS to play with my friends. 

- at the age of fourteen, I was accepted at the technical school in computer science, But i not finished cos'I didn't feel I was learning something usefull (outdataded contentschollar) 

- I learn some English, And i can use as well, but im not a good speaker language. Native Language > Portuguese.

- Learning Linux Terminal, Git, Github, Excel,  And Html. 

- Iâ€™m looking for help with About to be a DEV

- Why im learning? Curiosity, As a Hobbie, because i Like it :D

- Futures Objetives is "work-to-learn" use one job as Dev to learn and find another opportunities to learn.
